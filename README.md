## Overview
HASHIRU is an agent-based framework designed to dynamically allocate and manage large language models (LLMs) and external APIs through a CEO model. The CEO model acts as a central manager, capable of hiring, firing, and directing multiple specialized agents (employees) over a given budget. It can also create and utilize external APIs as needed, making it highly flexible and scalable.
